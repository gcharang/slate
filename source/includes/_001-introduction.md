# Introduction

Welcome to the Komodo API Reference Guide.

Komodo's blockchain technology enables developers to run fully independent blockchains in a secure and highly competitive environment.

Each independent blockchain built on the Komodo framework has a wide range of capabilities, including:

* Bitcoin-hash rate supported security

* Zero-knowledge privacy

* Enterprise-level scalability

* Consensus-level smart contracts

* Cross-chain interoperability

* ...And more!

Because a Komodo-based blockchain is independently managed, the developer has complete freedom, so long as the essential connections to the Komodo ecosystem remain.
